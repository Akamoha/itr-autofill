# itr-autofill
A Chrome extension to auto-fill income tax returns on the Indian income tax department's e-filing portal using Form 16.

#### DISCLAIMER:
This project is for my own personal use only and I do not advocate the use of this tool to anyone else. I'm mainly just building this as an exercise in vibecoding. I chose this particular usecase because I have never written a Chrome extension and I'm rusty with JavaScript. Please do not use this as a serious tool to file your ITR. Most fields on the Income Tax portal are auto-populated correctly for salaried employees anyway.
